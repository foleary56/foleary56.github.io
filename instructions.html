				How to Build a Hammer
			</h2>

			<p class = "custom">If you are here looking to get into Woodworking, learn the basics, or get easy to follow guides to create beautiful projects, you are in the right spot!</p>


			<h2 class="step">Step One</h2>
			<p class="step2">Choose the size of hammer you want and select the appropriate wood. For a slightly larger mallet, I'll use a 4x6 piece of lumber. The head's size will be based on this, while the handle will be about 1/3 the width of the head, roughly an inch to an inch and a half.</p>

			<h2 class="step">Step Two</h2>
			<p class="step2">Cut the 4x6 to the desired head size—it doesn't need to be exact, just close to what you want. Do the same for the handle, leaving it longer than you think you need. You can cut these with various tools, from a hand saw to a circular saw.</p>

			<h2 class="step">Step Three</h2>
			<p class="step2">Now, you should have two blocks of wood. Decide if you want a round or square handle based on your tools. We'll demonstrate a square handle as it requires less complex tools.</p>

			<h2 class="step">Step Four</h2>
			<p class="step2">Mark the dead center of the head's top and draw a square slightly smaller than the handle size. Repeat this on the other side.</p>

			<h2 class="step">Step Five</h2>
			<p class="step2">Use a drill with an appropriate bit to drill out the center of the wood. Then, use a chisel to hollow out the center to form the square opening.</p>

			<h2 class="step">Step Six</h2>
			<p class="step2">Trim down the handle edges, making the bottom smaller than the top to fit through the head. Sand the handle using sandpaper or an orbital sander, but be careful not to take too much off. Leave more protruding from the top than you think, as you can trim it later.</p>

			<h2 class="step">Step Seven</h2>
			<p class="step2">Insert the handle through the head, ensuring it's tight and secure. Tap the bottom of the handle with a piece of wood to push the head on further.</p>

			<h2 class="step">Step Eight</h2>
			<p class="step2">Sand the mallet smooth, removing any sharp edges. Finish the wood with a polish—I recommend a beeswax polish to enhance the wood's appearance.</p>

			<h2 class="step">Step Nine</h2>
			<p class="step2">Allow the mallet to sit for a while and admire your handiwork! If the head ever becomes loose, flip the mallet upside down and tap the bottom of the handle lightly to secure it better.</p>
