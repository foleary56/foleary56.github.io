        <p class = "about">
            My name is Finn O'Leary. Before I get into how I got into woodworking, first I am going to tell you a little background about myself.
            I am currently a student at Mount Saint Mary's University in Emmitsburg, MD. I am studying computer science which I love a lot and actually see many
            similarities between woodworking and coding. Both of them you build something out of nothing and can make whatever you want with it. I always enjoy
            the struggles of figuring out and solving problems which made me love both Computer Science and Woodworking.<br><br>
            
            I have always been interested in building things out of anything, and creating projects. I really got into woodworking in 2020,
            about around the start of COVID, because I didnt have much to do. I instantly fell in love with it and build things such as a mancave, a bench,
            a table and many other things. Later into my journey I got into making smaller more intricate things such as cutting boards and hammers. I have 
            learned a lot throughout my journey and want to share it with you guys, so here are the main tips I have learned throughout the year. <br><br>
            If you are interested in getting into Woodworking do not hesitate at all. People always falsely think that woodworking is this insanely expensive
            difficult hobby to pick up, but in reality it is not true. The tools I started with were free, and I am sure you know someone who has tools that you
            can use. For instance I borrowed my dads and my grandpas and overtime bought my own. Starting out, I shopped using places like Facebook and Antique Shops
            (as shown in the common tools page), because they are places were you can get usable good tools for cheap. Dont be afraid to try out woodworking and if 
            you have any questions feel free to contact me!<br><br>
            Fun Fact!: I have an identical twin brother who doesnt look like me anymore, because he decided to grow a beard!!(I am on the left)
