                    <h1>Planer</h1><br>
                    <p>A planer in woodworking is a tool that is used to take a layer of wood off to make the board flatter and more level. There are different types of planers ranging in different price ranges. The biggest planer, can mill whole boards and make them level and this is the most expensive and easiest to get board flat and level. The next is the electric hand planer which you use in your hand and the blades spin and remove wood. This tool is more difficult to use because you have to be precise, but it works very well for small boards that aren't as wide. The final type of planer is an old-fashioned hand plane, which utilizes a sharp razor blade. This tool is typically used on the sides of a board to get them perfectly smooth. These tools are very handy, but only some of the important things when you are first getting into woodworking because you can choose to get your wood already planned.</p>

                    <h1>Table Saw</h1><br>
                    <p>The table saw is a very handy tool that helps speed up many processes in woodworking. The Table saw is a table that has a blade in the middle and you slide wood through it to cut it. The table saw has a fence where you can set it to a certain size, so you can consistently make the same measurement cut repeatedly. For instance, if you are making forms and need 20 pieces of wood 12 inches long, you set the fence at 12 inches and you don't have to measure the wood individually for every cut. This tool is very handy but is optional. A simple alternative is a circular saw.</p>

                    <h1>Circular Saw</h1><br>
                    <p>The circular saw is a handheld tool that is either electric or battery-powered. It is a tool that has a blade, either 6.5 inches or 7.25 inches. At the push of a button, these blades spin and cut the wood. After measuring the wood and marking the line to cut you slowly guide the saw and cut. I would recommend the circular saw as a necessary beginner saw and would say to get a corded electric saw because they are more powerful and you won't have to invest in batteries just yet. An alternative to a circular saw, if it is not in the budget, is a hand saw. A hand saw is more time-consuming but can easily make the cuts you need to get into beginner projects.</p>

                    <h1>Sander</h1><br>
                    <p>The sander is one of the most satisfying and necessary tools in your woodworking shop. The sander is used to make the surface of the wood smooth so when you glide your hand across it, it feels nice and you don't get any splinters. There are different kinds of sanders, but the one I recommend most is an orbital sander. You can get a corded orbital sander for not too much money and they do great work. One can get away with not even buying a sander and just sanding by hand with a sanding block, or just by using the sandpaper. </p>

                    <h1>Power Drill</h1><br>
                    <p>The power drill is a tool that is necessary for many woodworking projects. The main two things that you will do with the power drill are drill holes and set screws in wood. I'm sure everyone has seen a power drill and most have used one, but it is one tool I would say someone should get first. There isn't an alternative to the power drill unless you can find an old hand drill lying around but those are not used anymore.

                    <h1>Nail Gun / Hammer</h1><br>
                    <p>The nail gun is a tool that is very nice for projects, where you are building stuff and need a lot of nails. There are different kinds of nails, framing nails, brad nails, and finishing nails. Framing nails are the biggest and are typically used on bigger pieces of wood, like if you are nailing 2x4s together. These are used in bigger construction projects and are not as common in smaller projects. Brad nails are middle-sized nails that once they are in you don't see much and these aren't used for woodworking, rather they are used for installing trim, crown molding, etc. Finishing nails are the smallest and you can barely see them when they are in the wood which is why I look using them for woodworking. Finishing nails are used on the exterior boards of projects because you won't see them so it allows a clean finished project. You can use a nail gun for all of these different types, which is not a necessary tool to have. A nail gun typically requires an air compressor as well, so you should just have a hammer to start. A hammer is a tool that is cheap and most people have one lying around.

                    <h1>Wooden Mallet</h1><br>
                    <p>A wooden mallet is a hammer made of wood. A wooden mallet should be your first woodworking project. Many may be thinking, why would one need a metal hammer and a wooden hammer? The answer is simple, a wooden mallet you use to hit wood while metal hits metal. The wooden mallet is frequently used to tap pieces of wood into space and is also used to hit chisels into wood or drive wedges in. They are always and frequently used in projects to give the tap and boost that you need.

                    <h1>Clamps and Glue</h1><br>
                    <p>Some of the simplest things in woodworking can be the most useful at times. Clamps are used to hold wood together and are very useful in many projects, the simplest of them being a cutting board. The clamps clamp the wood together. Clamps are frequently paired with wood glue because you will glue to boards together and then clamp them immediately how you want them. This ensures the boards are secured together and the glue will be set in the correct position. The clamps are multipurpose and can also be used to hold something to a table while drilling, sanding, or working on the wood and need it to be still and not move. Clamps can also be used to hold pieces of wood where you want them, so you can have the wood in the correct spot if you want to nail it to another piece of wood or something.

                    <h1>Band Saw / coping saw</h1><br>
                    <p>The bandsaw is a very cool and unique tool. It is run by a motor and has a long very thin blade that is being spun rapidly so you can put wood through it to cut the wood. The band saw is used to make very precise cuts and you can make intricate shapes on the band saw, because of how small the blade is. It allows you to move your wood through it and create shapes such as circles. The band saw is a nice tool but is not necessary. If you want to make precise cuts like a band saw can, an alternative is the coping saw. The coping saw is essentially a handheld band saw that can be bought for very cheap and can work just as well, just takes time. They are easy to find at antique shops and I got mine for only $3.

                    <h1>Chisels</h1><br>
                    <p>Chisels are very handy tools in woodworking. Chisels are used to chisel small bits of wood off. It is frequently used with the wooden mallet because you can use more power with the chisel to chisel deep into the wood. They are frequently used to touch up the board and are used to cut some rough spots off of a board. They can be found for cheap at antique shops and used tool spots, but you should feel and make sure the chisel is sharp before purchasing.

                    <h1>Used Tools</h1><br>
                    <p>Now I know, that using tools is not a tool necessarily. I am just putting this up because the best way to get tools of your own to to shop for used tools. Some good spots to get used tools are antique shops and places like Facebook marketplace. I have gotten most of my tools for a significant discount because I chose to go the used route and buy the tools from these places. You can find great deals and save yourself a ton of money in the long run!

                    <h1>Best Tools: Free Tools</h1><br>
                    <p>Now the best type of beginner tools are FREE!!!! When I say free tools I mean tools that are already have around the house, or tools friends or family have that you can use to get into it. To get into woodworking, you don't need to invest a ton of money, just borrow tools from people you know. When I got interested in woodworking, I chose to borrow some of my dad's and grandpa's old tools which got me to grow to love the process of woodworking.</p>
