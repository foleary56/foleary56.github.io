			<p class = "term2">In woodworking there are countless terms that are constantly being used in order to describe what we are doing or what needs to be done on a given project. A lot of the terms are simple and many of them are not. These terms I have came up with are amongst the most used terms in woodworking. If you would like the defintion of the word, click to reveal.</p>
			<ul class="terms-list">
				<li class="terms-line">
					<h2 class="term">Jointing</h2>
					<p class="definition">When someone uses the term jointing, it is most frequently used when someone is about to glue wood together. Jointing means to clean and smooth off the edge of a board, typically in preparation for gluing.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="terms-line">
					<h2 class="term">Planing</h2>
					<p class="definition">The term planing is one that you will always hear about in woodworking. Planing is used when someone wants to smooth out the overall surface of the wood and they want to remove the excess wood. Planing is frequently used with sanding because you plan to remove the large excess of wood and then finish the wood by sanding it.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="terms-line">
					<h2 class="term">Sanding</h2>
					<p class="definition">The term sanding is used when someone wants to smooth out the wood. Sanding is a technique used for finishing wood where one uses sandpaper to smooth the surface of the wood. When doing this, you always start at a lower medium grit sandpaper and then work your way up to a higher grit, about 220 grit.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="terms-line">
					<h2 class="term">Gluing</h2>
					<p class="definition">Gluing is a term used when you are utilizing wood glue to attach multiple pieces of wood, creating one bigger piece of wood for a project. Gluing is frequently used in many projects, one of which is a cutting board.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="terms-line">
					<h2 class="term">Routing</h2>
					<p class="definition">Routing has to do with the process of finishing the edges of a piece of wood or of a project. People do this at the end of their project to finish the edge and put a certain edge on a project so that it is not the normal sharp edge. Most people do this with the router tool, but you can also do this with normal sandpaper or a sander, you just have to be careful.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="terms-line">
					<h2 class="term">Sawing</h2>
					<p class="definition">Sawing is a very simple term used in woodworking and it refers to when you are cutting wood. Sawing refers to all of the different kinds of tools that are used to cut and do not have one unique tool that utilizes the term.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="terms-line">
					<h2 class="term">Finishing</h2>
					<p class="definition">Finishing wood is the process of applying a stain or lacquer on the wood. Applying a coat of this will help make the wood pop, and will also do some work to protect the wood over time through the elements. There are many different kinds of stains and lacquers one could use, it just depends on their goal and what they want.</p>
